          Play
-------------------------
-Simple Game that depicts a ping pong match with 3 as a winning point.
-The game will start off with the ball in speed 2
-As the game progresses the difficulty also increases since the speed will increment. (Until speed 7 and then automatically adjusts to 5 to be realistic)
-All you have to do is get the ball across the table and try your hardest to outwit the opponent and get past his/her defenses.  
-Player 1 has the left and right arrow keys for movement.
-Player 2 has the A and D keys for movement.
-Every point earned by any player will prompt the game for a new setup. (Ball will go back to its starting position everytime someone scores)
-Whoever gets 3 pts the fastest will win the game.

Design Decisions & Issues
-------------------------
-Arena Patterned after hockey field.
-The ball will change color depending on who leads the game (added incentive)
-Color scheme was based on the Philippine Flag. (huehuehue)
-Issue #1 lags when both Player 1 Racquet and Player 2 Racquet moves at the same time. (or maybe it's just my laptop but nevertheless I'll research more on keyevents sir)
-Issue #2 racquet edge collisions are safe. (Although it rarely happens in real life)
-Should have used one class for Players.
-All audios used in the game are downloaded from http://www.wavsource.com/
